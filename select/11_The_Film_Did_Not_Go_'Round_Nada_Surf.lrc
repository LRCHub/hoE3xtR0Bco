[00:32.89] Take a train to a bus, and then into the air
[00:39.14] Take a train to a bus, and then into the air
[00:44.55] If I had wings, I'd follow you up there
[01:04.05] 
[01:05.24] Girl you know I hate to see you go
[01:12.58] I hate to see you go
[01:17.93] But the sunlight follows you right down the road

[02:56.21] You'll be waiting by my bed I know
[03:02.53] And your last little words will be i love you so
